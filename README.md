# pthread

This is a freelancing project which was done and its based on multithreading.

The writeup document give a brief understanidng about how the code works.

I use C as the main programming language.I have used pthread library.

Here are the commands:

1.Go to the relavant file directory and open terminal (Linux based OS is prefered and make sure the gcc compiler has installed)

2.Type this command in the terminal:

    gcc -o final final.c -lpthread
    
3.final.c is the source file name and final is the executable file name. You can change those names.

4.Then type this in the terminal:

	./final 10000 10 10
  
5.The command line arguments can be changed upto (./final 1000000 50 50 )

6.Result will be saved inside the result.txt file
